# STAT-706

Generalized Linear Models I

Course Overview:
- STAT 706 (GLM I) will introduce generalized linear models by building on ordinary linear regression within the larger generalized framework. The course will focus on regression applications for binary, count and multinomial data along with diagnostics and likelihood theory. All analyses and simulations will be completed using the R language.
