## Introduction

- Welcome!
- About me
- [Review syllabus](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_47472169_1&course_id=_1900070_1&mode=reset)
- [Course materials on Github](https://github.com/hunter-stats/stat706-class-materials)

## Course Goals

- Understand theory and math behind linear regression
- Understand how simulation/data generating can help mimic the math
- Expand the assumptions/equations behind linear regression to more general forms
- Gain some hands on experience with statistical programming through R

## Expectations

- Please keep your camera on if you are able to/comfortable doing so
- Please bear with me as I figure out how to best use blackboard etc. I may move platforms around at the beginning of the semester if I see something is lacking
- Take notes! The slides are not exhaustive
- Please speak up if you are having issues with any part of the course (material, homework, class times, discussion).
    - Utilize discussion boards or email/call me directly
